		<br><br>The Nochsana Fortress is under Siege! <br>
		Attackers, capture all Bases to spawn the Guardian and kill it to become victorious. <br>
		Defenders, prevent those attackers from killing your Guardian! <br>

		<br> But care! Not every Base is displayed on the Map. Maybe there is an hidden Base that allows some sneaky tactics? <br><br>
		Anyway, Fight for the Victory - The Beyond Aion Team and Woge Advanced English Language Skills.
